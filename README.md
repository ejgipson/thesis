# thesis
Scripts I've written to automate tasks for my thesis
rename.sh is used to update my job-name tag in my submission file for my VASP jobs
report.sh is used to pull the job-name tag and last instance of TOTEN from my completed VASP jobs and organizes them column wise
makePOSCAR.py is used to take information about where to place a dopant atom in a lattice and builds a POSCAR file - this is the proof of concept version
